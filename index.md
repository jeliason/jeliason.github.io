I study the tumor microenvironment and the tumor-immunity cycle through multiscale and mechanistic statistical modelling in the [Popel lab](https://popellab.johnshopkins.edu/) - in particular, I am very focused on constructing *well-calibrated*, *verified*, *validated* and *literature-supported* mechanistic models of tumor-immune interactions.

### Research interests
- Uncertainty quantification and validation in mechanistic immune-oncology models
- Bayesian modeling of hierarchical and multi-likelihood (joint) datasets
- Spatial point‚Äêprocess methods for multiplexed tissue imaging
