I study the tumor microenvironment and the tumor-immunity cycle through multiscale and mechanistic statistical modelling in the [Popel lab](https://popellab.johnshopkins.edu/) - in particular, I focus on constructing *well-calibrated*, *verified*, *validated* and *literature-supported* mechanistic models of tumor-immune interactions.

I completed my PhD in Bioinformatics at the University of Michigan, where my thesis focused on multiscale statistical models for understanding tumor microenvironment heterogeneity.
